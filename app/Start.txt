There two types of component in Next js, server side component and client side component
By default all the components in the NextJS project acts as server side components.
Server Components just render on the server first, then send the HTML to the browser.
image-slideshow.js has the state but it will not run the browser.
We need to mention use client to make it client side component.
We can make child component with use client and inject that into server component
we can Suspense component to show fallback page untill data loads onto screen.
we can create server action 'use server' inside a function, which will be executed on the server.
This is used at function/file level.
we cant add 'use client' and 'use server' is same file. But we can import different server into client file like Share page.js and actions.js
